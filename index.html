      <p>I am a neuroscience PhD candidate and NSF GRFP Fellow in Todd Constable’s Laboratory at Yale University. My current work focuses on using fMRI connectivity 
        and predictive modeling to understand the neurobiological bases of cognitive dysfunctions that co-occur with psychiatric symptoms. Cognitive deficits and 
        patterns of brain network functioning are highly variable in psychiatric populations, and characterizing the related disordered neural circuits can be valuable 
        for guiding precise, individual-specific interventions. My goal is to apply the methods I am developing to optimize personalized treatment protocols, such as 
        transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive training interventions. <p>
      <br>
      <p>Before to coming to Yale, I was a research coordinator and data analyst at the Neuroscape Center at UCSF working on clinical trials evaluating whether cognitive 
        enhancement technologies could improve cognition in clinical populations. The key assumption was that by engaging the brain networks that support cognitive 
        functions, we could alleviate symptoms of psychiatric disorders where cognitive dysfunctions are believed to be core to their etiology. In numerous successful 
        studies, we found that, on average, our interventions improved cognition and reduced symptoms. However, I repeatedly observed that they did not work equally well 
        for everyone, paralleling findings from the pharmacology and brain stimulation literatures. Presumably, this stemmed from heterogeneity in brain networks. 
        Following my evolving curiosity about how to use brain imaging to optimize treatment protocols led me to the research I am currently working on.
